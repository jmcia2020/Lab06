Reading Notes: Lab 6
Web Pages are created from 3 separate languages that concern themselves with different aspects in the development of the webpage.  
This is called the separation of concerns.

All three are text files with different extension tags.
HTML focuses on content (.html)CSS focuses on style (.css)
JavaScript focuses on the behaviors of the website. (.js)

JavaScript, like CSS. links to the HTML code.  
The .js file is usually linked at the bottom of the body within the HTML code using the <script> element.
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 

Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
Curly braces indicate the start and end of a code block.

JavaScript is case sensitive.  thisIsCamelCasing

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and Booleans.

Strings data consists of letters and other characters. 
Booleans are true or false values.
